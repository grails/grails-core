/**
 * Binds a GORM-owned {@link ClientSession} into Spring Data MongoDB's thread-bound resources so that
 * a {@code MongoTemplate} executes within the same MongoDB transaction GORM started.
 *
 * <p>This lives in {@code org.springframework.data.mongodb} because Spring Data's
 * {@link MongoResourceHolder} (the resource a {@code MongoTemplate} looks up to discover an active
 * session) is package-private. Only the holder construction needs that access; binding, unbinding
 * and rebinding go through the public {@link TransactionSynchronizationManager} keyed by the
 * {@link MongoDatabaseFactory}, so callers can treat the holder as an opaque object.</p>
 *
 * <p><strong>Invariant:</strong> GORM owns the {@link ClientSession} lifecycle (it commits/aborts and
 * closes it). The holder bound here is effectively read-only for Spring Data — {@code MongoTemplate}
 * only reads the session from it; nothing in this module asks Spring Data to commit or close the
 * session, so there is no double-close.</p>
 *
 * <p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> this depends on the package-private
 * {@code MongoResourceHolder(ClientSession, MongoDatabaseFactory)} constructor of Spring Data MongoDB
 * (verified against the 5.x line shipped with Spring Boot 4). A change to that internal type would
 * break compilation, which the dedicated coupling smoke test surfaces explicitly. Because this is a
 * deliberate split package with Spring Data, this module is supported on the class path only and is
 * not compatible with the Java Platform Module System (JPMS) module path.</p>
