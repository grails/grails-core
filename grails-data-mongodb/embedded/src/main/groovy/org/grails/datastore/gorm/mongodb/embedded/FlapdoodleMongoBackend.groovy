 * {@code ~/.embedmongo}. Because it is actual MongoDB, transactions, change streams and
 * {@code $text} all behave as they do in production, and the data can be kept between
 * runs.
 *
 * <p>Flapdoodle is not a dependency of this module: it pulls in jgrapht, which is offered
 * under LGPL-2.1 or EPL-2.0, and an Apache release should not require it. An application
 * that wants a real mongod adds {@code de.flapdoodle.embed:de.flapdoodle.embed.mongo}
 * itself, the same way an application picks its own SQL database driver. Every reference
 * to flapdoodle is therefore confined to methods that {@link #isAvailable()} guards.
