/**
 * Turns a mongod started with a replica set name into one that answers.
 *
 * <p>A replica set of one is what a single machine can offer, and it is enough for everything a
 * standalone server refuses: a multi-document transaction, a change stream, a causally consistent
 * read. MongoDB does not configure it from the command line - the set is initiated by a command
 * sent to the server it names - so this is the step between starting the process and handing the
 * server to an application.
 *
 * <p>Every reference to the MongoDB driver lives here, so a standalone embedded server needs
 * nothing of it on the class path.
