/**
 * Starts an embedded MongoDB before the application context refreshes and publishes its
 * connection URL into whichever configuration properties the application reads, so an
 * application runs without a MongoDB installation and without Docker.
 *
 * <p>This is an {@link ApplicationContextInitializer} rather than an auto configuration
 * because the URL has to be in the {@code Environment} before the datastore bean that
 * reads it is created.
 *
 * <p>Asked for by the URL, the way an in-memory SQL database is. An application names the
 * embedded server where it would otherwise name a host, and the environment that wants one says
 * so where it already says which database to talk to:
 *
 * <pre>
 * environments:
 *     development:
 *         grails:
 *             mongodb:
 *                 url: mongodb://embedded/bookstore
 *     production:
 *         grails:
 *             mongodb:
 *                 url: mongodb://localhost:27017/bookstore
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>Nothing else switches it on, and nothing switches it off: a URL naming a host is served by
 * the driver and no server is started, exactly as an application with {@code h2} on the classpath
 * and a PostgreSQL URL never starts H2. A port may be given -- {@code mongodb://embedded:27018/db}
 * -- and is otherwise chosen below.
 *
 * <p>The rest configures the server behind that URL rather than which server to reach:
 * <table>
 * <caption>Supported properties</caption>
 * <tr><td>{@code embedded.mongodb.backend}</td><td>{@code in-memory} or {@code flapdoodle};
 *     defaults to flapdoodle when it is on the classpath, otherwise in-memory</td></tr>
 * <tr><td>{@code embedded.mongodb.property-names}</td><td>comma separated properties that may
 *     name an embedded server, {@code grails.mongodb.url} by default</td></tr>
 * <tr><td>{@code embedded.mongodb.database-dir}</td><td>keeps the data after the server
 *     stops, which only the flapdoodle backend can do</td></tr>
 * <tr><td>{@code embedded.mongodb.version}</td><td>the MongoDB version, where the backend
 *     can choose one</td></tr>
 * </table>
 *
 * <p>A host genuinely named {@code embedded} cannot be reached through these properties; name it
 * by its address or its fully qualified name instead.
 *
 * <p>Making the target property configurable is what keeps this useful outside Grails
 * Data: point {@code property-names} at {@code spring.data.mongodb.uri} and it serves a
 * plain Spring Boot application, although Spring Data users are generally better served
 * by flapdoodle's own {@code de.flapdoodle.embed.mongo.spring3x} auto configuration,
 * which this deliberately does not duplicate.
 *
 * @since 8.0
