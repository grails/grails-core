/**
 * A {@link Transaction} backed by a real MongoDB multi-document transaction on a
 * {@link ClientSession}. Unlike the legacy
 * {@link org.grails.datastore.mapping.transactions.SessionOnlyTransaction} (which only flushes the
 * GORM session), this commits or aborts a server-side transaction so multiple writes are atomic.
 *
 * <p>The {@link ClientSession} is started with an active transaction before this object is
 * constructed; {@link #commit()} flushes the GORM session (a no-op when the
 * {@link org.grails.datastore.mapping.transactions.DatastoreTransactionManager} already flushed)
 * and commits the server transaction, while {@link #rollback()} aborts it. Both close the
 * {@link ClientSession} and detach it from the owning session.</p>
 *
 * <p>Commit is retried on an {@code UnknownTransactionCommitResult} error label. Whole-transaction
 * retry on a {@code TransientTransactionError} is intentionally not handled here: it requires
 * re-executing the transaction body, which the
 * {@link org.grails.datastore.mapping.transactions.DatastoreTransactionManager} — a Spring
 * {@code PlatformTransactionManager} — cannot do (it only begins, commits and rolls back; the
 * application code between those is not re-runnable at this layer). Such retry is left to the
 * application (as Spring Data MongoDB's own {@code MongoTransactionManager} does), since re-running
 * the body would repeat its side effects.</p>
