## grails-compat

This subproject contains a compatibility layer related to a lot of the refactoring that was done while building Grails 3.
Many of the classes that were refactored out of the `org.codehaus...` package tree have deprecated counterparts here that mostly just extend or delegate to their repackaged replacements.
