/**
 * A property annotation used to automatically populate a field with the current auditor
 * upon GORM insert events. The current auditor is retrieved from an {@link org.grails.datastore.gorm.timestamp.AuditorAware}
 * bean registered in the Spring application context.
 *
 * <p>Example usage:</p>
 * <pre>{@code
 * class Book {
 *     @CreatedBy
 *     String createdBy
 *
 *     @CreatedBy
 *     User creator
 *
 *     @CreatedBy
 *     Long creatorId
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>The field type should match the type parameter of your {@link org.grails.datastore.gorm.timestamp.AuditorAware}
 * implementation (e.g., String, Long, User, etc.).</p>
