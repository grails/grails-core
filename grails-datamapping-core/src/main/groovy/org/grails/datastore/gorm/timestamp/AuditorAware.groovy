/**
 * Interface for components that are aware of the application's current auditor.
 * This will be used to populate @CreatedBy and @LastModifiedBy annotated fields
 * in domain objects.
 *
 * <p>Implementations should be registered as Spring beans. The type parameter
 * should match the type of the auditor field in your domain classes (e.g., User,
 * Long, String, etc.).</p>
 *
 * <p>Example implementation:</p>
 * <pre>{@code
 * @Component
 * public class SpringSecurityAuditorAware implements AuditorAware<String> {
 *     @Override
 *     public Optional<String> getCurrentAuditor() {
 *         return Optional.ofNullable(SecurityContextHolder.getContext())
 *                 .map(SecurityContext::getAuthentication)
 *                 .filter(Authentication::isAuthenticated)
 *                 .map(Authentication::getName);
 *     }
 * }
 * }</pre>

 * @param <T> the type of the auditor (e.g., User, Long, String)
