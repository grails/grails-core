/**
 * Registers the persistence runtime a datastore reaches through Groovy.
 *
 * <p>Reading and writing an entity goes through the mapping context, the persister for its
 * datastore, and the query and event machinery around them, and Groovy reaches all of it
 * dynamically. Fields are registered as well as methods because a persister hands work to anonymous
 * inner classes that read the state they captured as properties -- deleting an entity reads the
 * session that way -- and a native image that keeps only the members something asked for leaves the
 * class present with that state unreachable.</p>
 *
 * <p>Which datastore is registered follows from what is on the classpath: the scan covers the shared
 * packages, and an implementation puts its own persisters and query support in them, so MongoDB and
 * the others are covered without naming any of them here.</p>
 *
 * <p>Recording this with the framework rather than leaving it to a tracing agent matters because the
 * agent records only what ran. Reads are exercised by anything that opens a page; the write and
 * delete paths reach persister internals that a read never touches, so they fail for the first
 * person who saves or removes a record.</p>
