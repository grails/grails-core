/**
 * Resolves one message from each way a bundle reaches the message source, and fails if any of them
 * does not resolve.
 *
 * <p>Run on a JVM this proves two things. That every bundle is reachable at all — which is a real
 * guard, because Spring Boot's message source is configured from {@code MessageSourceProperties},
 * and a bean created before {@code ConfigurationPropertiesBindingPostProcessor} is registered keeps
 * its defaults, silently losing every base name except {@code messages}. And, when compiled into a
 * GraalVM binary, that each bundle was registered as a resource — a failure no JVM run can produce,
 * because on a JVM every bundle on the classpath is readable whether it was registered or not. A
 * bundle missing from an image surfaces as a code resolving to itself, not as an exception, because
 * {@code spring.messages.use-code-as-default-message} is on.</p>
 *
 * <p>Only the first of the three is covered by Spring Boot's own hints, which register the two
 * hardcoded patterns {@code messages.properties} and {@code messages_*.properties} and derive
 * nothing from the configured base names.</p>
