Getting Started

You need a Java Development Kit (JDK) installed, but it is not necessary to install Groovy because it's bundled with the Grails distribution.

To install Grails, visit http://grails.org/Download and download the version you would like to use. Set a GRAILS_HOME environment variable to point to the root of the extracted download and add GRAILS_HOME/bin to your executable PATH. Then in a shell, type the following:
	
	grails create-app sampleapp
	cd sampleapp
	grails run-app
	
To build Grails, clone this GitHub repository and then in a shell, type the following:
	
	./gradlew install
