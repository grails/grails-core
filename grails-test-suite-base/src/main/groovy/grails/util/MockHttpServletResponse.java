/**
 * Subclass Spring's MockHttpServletResponse to tag the methods that have been deprecated in
 * the Servlet API.
 * <p>
 * Because Spring's MockHttpServletResponse doesn't tag these methods as deprecated, the
 * compiler outputs noisy warnings complaining that we're using deprecated methods if we use
 * the raw MockHttpServletResponse from Spring.  By subclassing Spring's
 * MockHttpServletResponse and tagging the methods as deprecated, we acknowledge to the
 * compiler that these methods are deprecated, and we silence the compiler warnings.
 * <p>
 * Created: 08-Feb-2008
 *
 * @deprecated as of 7.0 in favor of using {@link org.springframework.mock.web.MockHttpServletResponse} directly.
