/**
 * <p>Parses a Grails URL mapping into a UrlMappingData object that holds various information about the mapping</p>
 *
 * <p>A Grails URL pattern is not a regex, but is an extension to the form defined by Apache Ant and used by
 * Spring AntPathMatcher. Unlike regular Ant paths Grails URL patterns allow for capturing groups in the form:</p>
 *
 * <code>/blog/(*)/**</code>
 *
 * <p>The parenthesis define a capturing group. This implementation transforms regular Ant paths into regular expressions
 * that are able to use capturing groups</p>
