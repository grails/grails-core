/**
 * This annotation may be applied to a class or to a field to
 * customize the data binding process.
 *
 * When the annotation is applied to a field, the value assigned to the
 * annotation should be a Closure which accepts 2 parameters.  The first
 * parameter is the object that data binding is being applied to.  The second
 * parameter is a {@link grails.databinding.DataBindingSource} containing the values being bound to the object.
 * The value returned by the Closure will be bound to the field.  The
 * following code demonstrates using this technique to bind an upper
 * case version of the value in the DataBindingSource to the field.
 *
<pre>
class SomeClass {
    &#064;BindUsing({
        obj, source -&gt; source['name']?.toUpperCase()
    })
    String name
}
</pre>
 *
 * When the annotation is applied to a class, the value assigned to the
 * annotation should be a class which implements the {@link BindingHelper}
 * interface.  An instance of that class will be used any time a value
 * is bound to a property in the class that this annotation has been
 * applied to.

class SomeClass {
    String someProperty
    Integer someOtherProperty
