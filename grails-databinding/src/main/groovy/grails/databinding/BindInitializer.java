/**
 * This annotation may be applied to a a field to
 * customize initialization of object properties in the data binding process.
 *
 * When the annotation is applied to a field, the value assigned to the
 * annotation should be a Closure which accepts 1 parameter.  The 
 * parameter is the object that data binding is being applied to.  
 * The value returned by the Closure will be bound to the field.  The
 * following code demonstrates using this technique to bind a contact
 * to user with the same account as the user.
 *
<pre>
class Contact{
  Account account
  String firstName
} 
class User {
    &#064;BindInitializer({
        obj -&gt; new Contact(account:obj.account)
    })
    Contact contact
    Account account
}
