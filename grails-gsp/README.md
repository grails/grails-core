## Grails GSP

This subproject is required for all Grails 3 applications and plugins that require GSP processing.  If your project includes GSPs you should add the following to your `build.gradle` which is provided by the [Grails Gradle Plugin](https://github.com/grails/grails-core/tree/master/grails-gradle-plugin).

``` gradle
apply plugin: "org.grails.grails-gsp"
```

It is typical of standard Grails 3 application to use this in conjunction with `grails-web` as in the following example:

``` gradle
apply plugin: "org.grails.grails-web"
apply plugin: "org.grails.grails-gsp"
```
