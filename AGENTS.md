# Agent Guide for grails-core

> **IMPORTANT**: This is the Grails Framework source repository (60+ modules), NOT a Grails application.
> For building Grails apps, see `.agents/skills/grails-developer/SKILL.md`.

## Quick Reference

```bash
# Build (no tests)
./gradlew build -PskipTests

# Build single module
./gradlew :grails-core:build

# Run tests
./gradlew :<module>:test
./gradlew :<module>:test --tests "com.example.SomeSpec"

# Style check
./gradlew codeStyle

# Out of memory? Set:
export GRADLE_OPTS="-Xms2G -Xmx5G"
```

## Critical Rules

1. **Use `jakarta.*` NOT `javax.*`** - All packages migrated to Jakarta EE 10
2. **Use `@GrailsCompileStatic`** - Not plain `@CompileStatic` in Grails artefact classes
3. **Use `GrailsWebRequest.lookup()`** - For thread-safe request context in tests
4. **No wildcard imports** - Use explicit imports
5. **4 spaces, no tabs** - See `.editorconfig`
6. **Apache license header** - Required on all new source files
7. **New features require docs** - Any user-facing change must include or update documentation in `grails-doc`; do not merge features without corresponding doc coverage
8. **No internal APIs in docs** - Only document public APIs; never reference internal or package-private classes and methods in user-facing documentation
9. **Test via public APIs** - Tests must exercise behavior through the same APIs an end user calls; never invoke internal implementations, package-private methods, or bypass the public surface directly
10. **Always review and extend tests** - Review existing unit and functional tests before making changes; every code change must include new or enhanced tests that cover the affected behavior
11. **Every code touch must update all tests for the changed class** - When a class is modified, find and update every test that covers it — unit, integration, and TCK. Do not leave any existing test out of sync with the new code.
12. **Clean violations before commit** - Before every automated commit, run `./gradlew clean aggregateViolations :grails-test-report:check --continue` from the root and ensure that `build/reports/violations/CHECKSTYLE_VIOLATIONS.md`, `build/reports/violations/CODENARC_VIOLATIONS.md`, `build/reports/violations/PMD_VIOLATIONS.md`, and `build/reports/violations/SPOTBUGS_VIOLATIONS.md` report no issues. Also review the test result reports under `grails-test-report/build/reports/tests/` and ensure there are no failures. The aggregate reports are wired as test finalizers and will be attempted after failures, but `--continue` is required for comprehensive full-suite reports.
13. **Mandatory test coverage** - Any class touched in a commit MUST be covered with tests that verify all behavior. You must run ALL tests in the affected module(s) and ensure they pass before committing.
14. **The BOM must manage the latest version** - `validateDependencyVersions` enforces that the BOM (`dependencies.gradle`) manages a version `>=` every transitively-resolved version. When it fails, **bump the version in `dependencies.gradle`** so the BOM wins — never silence it with `allowedBomOverrides` or an exclusion unless there is an explicit, documented conflict or an agreed-upon workaround. See [Dependency Management](#dependency-management).
15. **GitHub Actions must use ASF-approved pins** - Every third-party action SHA must appear in the ASF allowlist. See [GitHub Actions](#github-actions).

## Project Structure

This repository contains multiple independent Gradle projects:

| Project | Description | Build Command |
|---------|-------------|---------------|
| **grails-core** (root) | Main framework with 60+ modules | `./gradlew build` |
| **build-logic/** | Gradle convention plugins for the build | `cd build-logic && ./gradlew build` |
| **grails-gradle/** | Grails Gradle plugins | `cd grails-gradle && ./gradlew build` |
| **grails-forge/** | Application generator (like Spring Initializr) | `cd grails-forge && ./gradlew build` |
| **end-to-end/** | End-to-end tests consuming published Grails artifacts (see `end-to-end/README.md` for required setup) | `cd end-to-end && ./gradlew check` |

Each project has its own `settings.gradle` and independent build. When working on a specific project, run Gradle commands from that project's directory.

## Dependency Management

All managed dependency versions live in `dependencies.gradle` (the single source of truth for the BOM projects). The `validateDependencyVersions` task — run automatically in CI — enforces the rules below.

- **The BOM must manage the latest (winning) version.** Validation fails when a transitive dependency resolves to a version *newer* than the BOM manages. The fix is to **bump the version in `dependencies.gradle`** so the BOM's version is `>=` everything on the classpath and stays authoritative. This is the *purpose* of the check — keeping the BOM ahead of its transitives.
- **Do not suppress validation to work around a bump.** `allowedBomOverrides` (per-project ext) and dependency exclusions are reserved for an explicit, documented conflict or an agreed-upon workaround — never as a shortcut to silence a version the BOM should simply manage. Comment the reason when you must use one.
- **A dependency managed in more than one BOM must use the *same* version everywhere.** Versions appear in `gradleBomDependencyVersions` (build tooling / `grails-gradle-bom`), `bomDependencyVersions` (`grails-bom`), and per-BOM `customBomVersions` blocks (e.g. `grails-micronaut-bom`). `grails-bom` re-declares the gradle-BOM constraints, and the Micronaut/Hibernate BOMs are consumed via `enforcedPlatform`. Declaring one coordinate (e.g. `org.ow2.asm:asm`) at two different versions across these maps produces irreconcilable strict constraints and breaks `enforcedPlatform` resolution. Pin it once, consistently.
- **Prefer inheriting from the Spring Boot BOM.** Do not re-pin a coordinate that `spring-boot-dependencies` (4.1.x) already manages unless you are intentionally overriding it to a newer version (e.g. a security fix); note the reason inline.

## Artefact Types

| Type | Pattern | Handler |
|------|---------|---------|
| Domain | `**/domain/**/*.groovy` | `DomainClassArtefactHandler` |
| Controller | `**/*Controller.groovy` | `ControllerArtefactHandler` |
| Service | `**/*Service.groovy` | `ServiceArtefactHandler` |
| TagLib | `**/*TagLib.groovy` | `TagLibArtefactHandler` |
| Interceptor | `**/*Interceptor.groovy` | `InterceptorArtefactHandler` |

## Code Patterns

### Spock Test Structure
```groovy
class MyServiceSpec extends Specification implements ServiceUnitTest<MyService> {
    def "feature description"() {
        given: "preconditions"
        def input = "test"

        when: "action"
        def result = service.process(input)

        then: "assertions"
        result != null
        result.status == "OK"
    }
}
```

### Mocking
```groovy
def repo = Mock(BookRepository)
1 * repo.save(_) >> savedBook  // expect 1 call, return savedBook
```

### Data-Driven Tests
```groovy
@Unroll
def "#a + #b == #c"() {
    expect: a + b == c
    where:
    a | b || c
    1 | 2 || 3
    4 | 5 || 9
}
```

### Framework Access
```groovy
// Thread-safe request context
GrailsWebRequest webRequest = GrailsWebRequest.lookup()

// Artefact registry
grailsApplication.getArtefacts(DomainClassArtefactHandler.TYPE)
```

## Groovy Style

```groovy
// DO: Safe navigation
book?.author?.name

// DO: Elvis operator
name ?: 'Unknown'

// DO: GStrings
"Hello ${user.name}"

// DO: Spread operator
books*.title

// DO: Static compilation
@GrailsCompileStatic  // or @CompileStatic for non-artefact classes
class MyService { }

// DON'T: Wildcard imports
// import java.util.*  ❌

// DON'T: javax packages
// import javax.servlet.*  ❌ → use jakarta.servlet.*

// DON'T: Section separator or grouping comments
// // --- Domain classes ---  ❌
// // ===== Helpers =====     ❌
```

## Test Isolation

> **WARNING**: Tests run in parallel (`maxParallelForks > 1`). Static state that is not properly reset in test cleanup can cause flaky tests in subsequent tests within the same fork.

- Use `GrailsWebRequest.lookup()` for thread-local context
- Clear artefacts: `grailsApplication.artefactInfo.clear()`
- Use `@Shared` for fields that should be reused by multiple feature methods in a Spec

## Build Commands

| Task | Command |
|------|---------|
| Build (no tests) | `./gradlew build -PskipTests` |
| Build module | `./gradlew :grails-core:build` |
| Test module | `./gradlew :grails-core:test` |
| Single test | `./gradlew :module:test --tests "pkg.MySpec"` |
| Single feature | `./gradlew :module:test --tests "pkg.MySpec.feature name"` |
| Force rerun | `./gradlew :module:test --rerun-tasks` |
| Style check | `./gradlew codeStyle` |
| Build docs | `./gradlew :grails-doc:publishGuide -x aggregateGroovydoc` |
| Debug | `./gradlew bootRun --debug-jvm` |

## GitHub Actions

Apache GitHub Actions policy blocks third-party actions unless they are on the organization allowlist. A workflow that uses an unlisted `uses:` SHA fails at **startup** before any job runs.

The allowlist source of truth is:

https://github.com/apache/infrastructure-actions/blob/main/approved_patterns.yml

Rules:

- Pin every third-party action to a **full commit SHA** that appears in that file, with a trailing `# version` comment.
- `actions/*`, `github/*`, and `apache/*` are allowed by namespace. Still SHA-pin them for supply-chain consistency.
- Do not use a newer SHA, tag, or major version until it is on the allowlist. If you need a new pin, open a PR against `apache/infrastructure-actions` (`actions.yml`, not the generated `approved_patterns.yml`).
- Before adding or bumping a `uses:` line, search `approved_patterns.yml` for that action and copy an approved SHA.

## Branch Naming (Auto-Labels PRs)

| Prefix | Label |
|--------|-------|
| `fix/` | bug |
| `feat/`, `feature/` | feature |
| `docs/` | documentation |
| `chore/`, `refactor/`, `test/`, `ci/`, `perf/`, `build/` | maintenance |
| `deps/` | deps |

## Pull Request Guidelines

1. **Fork & branch** from the target release branch (e.g., `7.0.x`)
2. **Run tests** before submitting: `./gradlew build --rerun-tasks`
3. **Run code style checks**: `./gradlew codeStyle`
4. **Clean violations**: Before committing, run `./gradlew clean aggregateViolations` from the root and ensure that `build/reports/violations/CHECKSTYLE_VIOLATIONS.md`, `build/reports/violations/CODENARC_VIOLATIONS.md`, `build/reports/violations/PMD_VIOLATIONS.md`, and `build/reports/violations/SPOTBUGS_VIOLATIONS.md` have no issues.
5. **Verify test coverage**: Ensure any touched class is covered by tests verifying all behavior. You must run ALL tests in the affected module(s) and ensure they pass before submission.
6. **Squash commits** into a single meaningful commit message
6. **Reference issues** in PR description (e.g., "Fixes #1234")
